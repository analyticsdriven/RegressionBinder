# TAMU STAT608 Regression Notes By Topic

Howdy! 

I'm a student at Texas A&M University's <a href = "https://analytics.stat.tamu.edu/eventspage/" target= "_Blank">M.S. Analytics Program</a> at May's Business School in the Houston CityCentre. We're a 5-semester, part-time, cohort based program for working professionals that holds synchronous online courses on Tuesdays and Thursdays 18:00 - 21:00 CST.

These are just my best attempt at problems based on the following topics listed in our syllabus using SAS JMP 14. These topics most closely follow <a href = "https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387096070" target = "_Blank"><i>A Modern Approach to Regression with R</i></a> by Dr. Simon Sheather. Please note that these exercises are just for my own practice, therefore they are done by a student and have not been reviewed.

Topic list:
1. Simple Linear Regression (i.e., straight line model)
2. Diagnostics for simple linear regression
3. Transformations
4. Weighted least squares
5. Multiple regression
6. Diagnostics for multiple regression
7. Model selection and prediction
8. Linear regression splines
9. Logistic regression
10. Poisson regression
11. Models with serially correlated errors
12. Bayesian approaches to regression and logistic regression
